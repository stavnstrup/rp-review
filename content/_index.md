title: Responsible Party Reviev of NISP
---

In bi-anually review of NISP data, the responsible parties are requested to review the standards assigned to them. The review is scoped only to identify flaws in the meta-data of a standard. Changes should be written in the respective cells in the relevant CSV file.

If you think

* a standard is obsolte and should be replaced with a newer version
* a standard should be deleted
* a standard should be assigned to another responsible party

then you should NOT change the CSV file, but instead submit an RFC with the relevant information to the IP CaT.
